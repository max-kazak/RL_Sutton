# Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences

This project reproduces results of the ["Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences" by Richard Sutton](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00115009).

It explores the type of incremental learning through temoral differences (TD) which can be applied to Reinforcement Learning.

Report.pdf contains summary of the experiments setup and compares their results.

## Code

Suttons replica.ipynb - Jupyter notebook that contains project code that can be run again to repeat project results.

To run Jupyter notebook one will need a Python3 setup with following libraries installed in it:
